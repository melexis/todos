# OPTIONS




# EXAMPLES

Show help and exit.

    todos.sh -h


Search default comments with default settings in a current directory and display the results on standard output.

    todos.sh


Search default comments with verbose/debug output, rewrite any output file if it exists, skip .git and build directories and put the results to three files in TXT, XML and HTML formats.

    todos.sh -v -f -D .git build -o todos.txt -x todos.xml -m todos.html


Search TODO, FIXME, OPEN and @2-3 letters@ in all files under src directory, ignore case, append additional lines that follows the line with the occurrence and generate a HTML report.

    todos.sh -f -e '\\bTODO\\b' '\\bFIXME\\b' '\\bOPEN\\b' '@[a-zA-Z]{2,3}@' \
